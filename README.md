# RACES
RACES is an Advanced Cancer Evolution Simulator.

RACES is framework for simulating cancer genomic evolution. It supports:
-   cell strand competition and spacial simulations
-   epigenetic switches
-   copy-number variations
-   SBS and indel signature support
-   sequencing simulation

RACES consists in a library `libRACES` and 6 main CLI tools:
-   `species_sim` performs cell spacial simulation by using species evolutional information. It supports epigenetic switching.
-   `build_context_index` creates an index for the mutational contexts (i.e., consecutive triplets of nucleotides) in a genome. 
    This index is used to place passenger SNVs according to SBS signatures. In normal conditions, the context index for a
    genome must be created once for all and the resulting file can be used many times.
-   `build_repetition_index` creates an index for the repeated sequences in a genome. This index is used to place indels according
    to ID signatures. As for the `build_context_index`, the repeated sequences index for a genome must be created once for all and
    the resulting file can be used many times.
-   `tissue_sampler` samples the results of `species_sim`.
-   `descendants_builder` builds the descendants forest from the species simulation.
-   `mutations_sim` builds the phylogenetic forest for the sampled cells, and places mutations (only SNVs and CNAs are supported at the moment) on the tree. It can:
    *   produce simulated reads and generate the correspoding SAM file for them;
    *   collect SNVs, indels, and CNAs statistical data and save them in CSV files.

## Required Packages
